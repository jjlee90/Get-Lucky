*Black Jack *

The objective of the game is to get build a winning hand by getting as close as you can to 21 without going over. Both player and dealer will start with two cards. Player has the first option to "hit" (take another card) and "stand" (stay at their current hand). After the player stands, the dealer will draw cards until they have a minimum hand total of 17. Whoever has the highest total without going over 21 at the end of the drawing phase is declared the winner. 


*Standard blackjack rules apply. Dealer stands on soft 17. Currently the game does not support split hands, double downs, or insurance. *


*Winner Winner Chicken Dinner*

Winning hands pay out 1:1
Blackjack pays 3:2
Push: tie, wager is added back to bankroll

*BUGS*

Aces value is 11, but after the hand is complete the ace value is set to 1. It isn't resetting to 11 when it should. 

After hand is completed screen opacity is reduced by 50% indicating the hand is complete. If a button is clicked all handlers are removed from the browser and becomes unplayable unless the screen is refreshed.
